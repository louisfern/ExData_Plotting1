## Introduction

This is my solution for the first programming assignment in "Exploratory
Data Analysis", offered January 2016 on Coursera.org. It uses data from 
the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, which can be separately downloaded 
from either the course website or UC Irvine. I am not including the raw data in
this repository, as it is >100MB, and including it here is a significant 
bandwidth burden.
